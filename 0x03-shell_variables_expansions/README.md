# Executable Scripts: 0-alias--to create an alias with Name: ls and Value: rm * . 1-hello_you--to create a script that prints hello user where user is the Linux user. 2-path--to add /action to the PATH. /action which is the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program. 3-paths--The command echo $PATH|tr ':' '\n'|wc -l breaks down the $PATH environment variable into its individual directories by replacing the : character (which separates the directories in $PATH) with a newline character \n. The resulting directories are then counted using the wc -l command. The final output of this command is the number of directories listed in the $PATH environment variable.
